                This first section tests your ability to do basic addition. This
                section consists of three questions, of which you will be asked to
                answer two.

            <p>
                <em>
                    The response to the first question will determine which question
                    gets presented next; a correct answer to the first question will
                    mean that the second question presented is question 2, otherwise
                    question 3 will be presented (this is mutually exclusive, so you
                    will only see either question 2 or question 3).
